the idea of drawable systems are system that will need a beginDraw and endDraw method
for now the only system that has the draw method is the window, but the goal is to have
the window class only to have the informatins about the window and something else to draw whatever is in it

one drawable system to be the hud
- maybe this system will have slots to put images to be skills
- another slot to be the health and mana bar (or sphere)

take another look about the 'move' semanthics in c++ (move constructor)
- since c++11 there's a new kind of operator called Class(Class&& c) that is used to pass values when making a copy is not needed	

need to change some of the Matrix4 functions
- some of them passes a matrix as parameter, but that matrix should be the actual matrix that is calling the function
   -> a solution is either convert the function to static or don't use the parameter anymore.
