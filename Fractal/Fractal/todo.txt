Create a config file

change the return function that has int to be some sort of define numbers to express sucess of kinds of error
- exemple: #define SUCESS 1
	     : #define FAIL_INIT -1
and so on...

the idea of drawable systems are system that will need a beginDraw and endDraw method
for now the only system that has the draw method is the window, but the goal is to have
the window class only to have the informatins about the window and something else to draw whatever is in it

one drawable system to be the hud
- maybe this system will have slots to put images to be skills
- another slot to be the health and mana bar (or sphere)

improve the input system
- create custom number referent to the sdl key numbers (so we don't have to include the whole sdl library)
