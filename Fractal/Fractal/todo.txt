create a timer system

define a world settings class that will hold all application properties
- window width and height and if its full screen or not
- window title
- bits per pixel if that is applied to opengl
- maybe something similar to the unity's input settings

change the return function that has int to be some sort of define numbers to express sucess of kinds of error
- exemple: #define SUCESS 1
	     : #define FAIL_INIT -1
and so on...

the idea of drawable systems are system that will need a beginDraw and endDraw method
for now the only system that has the draw method is the window, but the goal is to have
the window class only to have the informatins about the window and something else to draw whatever is in it

one drawable system to be the hud
- maybe this system will have slots to put images to be skills
- another slot to be the health and mana bar (or sphere)

improve the input system
- create custom number referent to the sdl key numbers (so we don't have to include the whole sdl library)

take another look about the 'move' semanthics in c++ (move constructor)
- since c++11 there's a new kind of operator called && that is used to pass values when making a copy is not needed	

(for the physics engine)
have a physics settings file that defines gravity and any other information we may need to hold
